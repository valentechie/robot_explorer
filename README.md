## üöÄ Introduction

C++ program that simulates a robot moving around a map. The dimensions of the board, the initial position of the robot and the obstacles can be found in the **`input.txt`** file. The user **can modify the data** in the input.txt file to make the game more dynamic.

The program will terminate when all the cells of the board have been visited or when the robot cannot move to any free cell. The number of free and occupied cells of the board should be displayed on the screen.

In addition, the final result of the program must be printed in a file called **`output.txt`**.

## üì¶ Installation

**1Ô∏è‚É£ Clone the repository:**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/valentechie/robot_explorer.git
```

**2Ô∏è‚É£ Navigate to the project folder:**
```bash
cd robot_explorer
```

**3Ô∏è‚É£ Compile the code:**
```bash
g++ robot_simulation.cpp -o robot_simulation
```

**4Ô∏è‚É£ Run the program:**
```bash
./robot_simulation
```

## üïπÔ∏è Usage

- Edit **`input.txt`** to set the board size, robot's starting position, and obstacles.
  
  **Example `input.txt`:**
  ```
  5 5          # Board size, rows(5) cols(5)
  2 2          # Robot starting position, row (2) col(2)
  1 0          # Obstacle at row (1) col (0)
  1 3          # Obstacle at row (1) col (3)
  ```

- Run the program.  
- Results are displayed on the terminal and saved in **`output.txt`**.
  
  **Example `output.txt`:**
  ```
  Total free cells visited: 23
  Total Occupied cells: 2

  Final board state:
  R # . . .
  * . . . .
  * * * . .
  . # . . .
  . . . . .
  ```

  **Legend:**  
  - `R` = Robot  
  - `#` = Obstacle  
  - `.` = Free cell
  - `*` = Occupied cell
