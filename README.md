## üöÄ Introduction

C++ program that simulates a robot moving around a map. The dimensions of the board, the initial position of the robot and the obstacles can be found in the **`input.txt`** file. The user **can modify the data** in the input.txt file to make the game more dynamic.

The program will terminate when all the cells of the board have been visited or when the robot cannot move to any free cell. The number of free and occupied cells of the board should be displayed on the screen.

In addition, the final result of the program must be printed in a file called **`output.txt`**.

---

## ‚ö° Quick Start

```bash
git clone https://github.com/valentechie/robot_explorer.git
cd robot_explorer
g++ robot_simulation.cpp -o robot_simulation
./robot_simulation
```
Edit **`input.txt`** as needed before running.  
See **`output.txt`** for the results.

- Edit **`input.txt`** to set the board size, robot's starting position, and obstacles.
- Run the program.  
- Results are displayed on the terminal and saved in **`output.txt`**.

---

## üìù Example Input/Output

**Example `input.txt`:**
```
5 5          # Board size (rows cols)
2 2          # Robot starting position (row col)
1 0 0        # Obstacle at (row col)
1 3 1        # Obstacle at (row col)
```

**Example `output.txt`:**
```
Total free cells visited: 23
Total obstacles encountered: 2
Final board state:
. . X . .
. . . . .
. . R . .
. . . . .
. X . . .
```
Legend:  
- `R` = Robot  
- `X` = Obstacle  
- `.` = Free cell
